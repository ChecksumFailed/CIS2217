Final Project  - Twitter 

Changes from midterm:
Change ArrayLists to HashMaps.  HashMap.get is O(1), Collection.Contains is O(n)

TwitterUser Class
1. New List - Followers
	a.  List of users following user.  
	b. Populate at flatfile load time
2. New comparator
	a. Number of followers (largest to smallest)
	b. If two users have the same number of followers, sort by the number of people that
		user is following (largest to smallest)
	c. If two users have the same number of followers and are following the same
		number of people, sort by user id (smallest to largest)

Twitter Class:
1. Sort list with comparator, based on number of followers.  Instead of by id
2.  Collection<TwitterUser> getFollowing(TwitterUser user)
	a. Return followers collection from TwitterUser Object
3. TwitterUser getByPopularity(int x)
